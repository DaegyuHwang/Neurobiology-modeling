### #This is a re-simulation of a published paper, "Neural heterogeneity controls computations in spiking neural networks."

While joining the Journal Club of the Computational Neuroscience Department, I had the opportunity to present this paper. 
This directory contains MATLAB code for simulating Yeast and Cicada population dynamics and their lab reports. 

This paper utilized the Lorentz distribution, which is equivalent to the Cauchy distribution.
Before directly using the equation in the paper, I mathematically formalized the Cauchy distribution and simulated it to check whether it follows the theoretical
probability density shape. Which is in the "Cauchyâ€“Lorentz distribution.pdf" file.
